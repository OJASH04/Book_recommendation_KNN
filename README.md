# Book_recommendation_KNN

For this project I made a simple book recommendation model using KNN. The model uses Nearest Neighbours alogrithm.
After fitting the model I made a function to get a list of recommended books after passing the title of the book.

The dataset used was [Book-Crossings dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/). This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
